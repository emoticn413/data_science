Challenge Description

We have data about users who hit our site: whether they converted or not as well as some of
their characteristics such as their country, the marketing channel, their age, whether they are
repeat users and the number of pages visited during that session (as a proxy for site
activity/time spent on site).

Your project is to:

Predict conversion rate
Come up with recommendations for the product team and the marketing team to
improve conversion rate
